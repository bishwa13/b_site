Welcome to my new Jekyll-powered website! This is a sample blog post to demonstrate the posting functionality.

## Getting Started

To create new posts, simply add markdown files to the `_posts` directory following the naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
```

## Features

This site includes:

- **Multi-level navigation** with dropdown menus
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Blog functionality** with categorized posts
- **SEO optimization** with meta tags
- **Fast loading** with minimal dependencies

## Writing Posts

Posts are written in Markdown format. You can include:

- Headers
- Lists
- Code blocks
- Links and images
- And much more!

### Code Example

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from Jekyll!")
    
hello_world()
```

## What's Next?

Start customizing your site by:

1. Editing `_config.yml` with your information
2. Adding more posts to `_posts/`
3. Creating pages for your navigation items
4. Customizing the CSS in `assets/css/main.css`

Happy blogging! 🎉
